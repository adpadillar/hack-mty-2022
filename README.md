# Contactless payments with facial recognition

## Inspiration

We were inspired by both Chubb's and Banorte's challenges, which are related to the modernization of banking and transactions.

## What it does

Enables transactions between bank accounts by just using the face of whoever you want to send money to, as the account id

## How we built it

We built a front-end as a pwa in nextjs, and a python api with flask to manage the facial recognition on this project

## Challenges we ran into

Linking the api with the frontend wasn't nearly as easy as we may have thought. Facial recognition also is a really challenging thing to get right

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of having a product that actually solves the problem we were aiming at solving, and can be revolutionary for the future of contactless payments

## What we learned

About both sides of the stack, front end and backend. Web technologies like nextjs as well as machine learning models with python

## What's next for Contacless Payments with facial recognition

Optimizing the product and make it more accurate, and possibly sell it to banking or other organizations around the world
